#Intro to variables

#Variables are abstract storage locations we associate with a name

food = 'Tacos'
name = 'Dylan'

print(food)
print('My name is:', name)

#Dynamic typing mean variaables can be reassigned
food = 'Pizza'
print(food)

#Execution flow is down the page meaning things below will eventually take priority
name = 'Travis'

#Multiple Assingment

first, middle, last = 'Dylan', 'Michael', 'Katina'

print(middle)

#Naming convention in Python

#Variables use: snake_case (lowercase, words separated by _ not spaces)
favorite_food = 'Tiramisu'
coding_temple = 'A great place to learn!'

#Constant variables (whos value will never change) (capital SNAKE_CASE)
NUM_PI = 3.14


#RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

#---- Don't start your variable with a number
# 1st_num = 1
num_1 = 1 

#---- snake_case (words separeted by _)
# this var = 'pizza'

#---- no symbols in your var names
# jack&jill = 'Ran up the hill'
jack_and_jill = 'early in the morning'

#----no reserved words included in the Python Errors Slides
# False = 'not true'
# print = 'a type of function'
# type 
# str
# int
# print('hello')
